I am Ph.D. student at Aalto University, working with Dr. Vikas Garg on machine learning applied to drug discovery. 

Previously, I worked on modling single-cell and bulk sequencing data with deep learning methods as a junior researcher in the [Systems Genomics - Hein√§niemi Lab](https://uefconnect.uef.fi/en/group/systems-genomics-heinaniemi-lab/) at the University of Eastern Finland.

You can find out more about me by browsing this website or looking at my [resume](https://najwalaabid.github.io/files/resume.pdf) (here is the [one page](https://najwalaabid.github.io/files/cv.pdf) version).
