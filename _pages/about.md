I am a junior researcher at the [Systems Genomics - Hein√§niemi Lab](https://uefconnect.uef.fi/en/group/systems-genomics-heinaniemi-lab/) at the University of Eastern Finland.
I work on applying machine learning models to study the genetic basis of biological phenomenon (by modeling single-cell and bulk sequencing data for example).
More broadly, I am interested in machine learning with probabilistic principles, uncertainty quantification in deep learning,
and efficient inference on long time series.

I earned my master's degree in information technology with a minor in statistics from the [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en) with a full scholarship.
During my master's studies, I interned at Dr. [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s group where I worked on developing inference algorithms for nonstationary 
Markov Gaussian Processes (based on [Bayesian filtering and smoothing](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/pub/cup_book_online_20131111.pdf)).
Before that, I did my [master's thesis](https://erepo.uef.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/26001/urn_nbn_fi_uef-20211253.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) on Botnet Command &amp; Control detection for IoT networks at [Ericsson - Finland](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/finland) under the supervision of Dr. [Gergely Matefi](https://hu.linkedin.com/in/gergely-matefi-b2a4787) and Dr. [Pauli Miettinen](https://cs.uef.fi/~pauli/).

I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration at [Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane](http://www.aui.ma/en/) in Morocco, also with a merit-based scholarship. My [capstone project](http://www.aui.ma/sse-capstone-repository/pdf/spring-2019/INTELLIGENT%20TUTORING%20SYSTEM%20FOR%20EARLY%20ALGEBRA.pdf) implemented an intelligent tutor for early algebra. During my Bachelor's studies, I worked as a tutor for the [Center of Learning and Excellence](https://kudos.aui.ma/), as a software developer at [ASC](https://www.ascbrazil.com.br/) and [Sankhya Jiva](https://www.sankhya.com.br/) in Minas Gerais - Brazil, and interned as a software engineer at [Google Munich](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/90591933023298246-software-engineer/). I was also awarded the [Generation Google Scholarship](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/generation-google-scholarship-emea/) in 2018 (previously Women Techmakers/Anita Borg scholarship).
