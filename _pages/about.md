I am at junior researcher at the [Systems Genomics - Hein√§niemi Lab](https://uefconnect.uef.fi/en/group/systems-genomics-heinaniemi-lab/) at the University of Eastern Finland.
I work on projects involving modeling single-cell data using generative models.
More broadly, I am interested in machine learning with probabilistic principles, uncertainty quantification in deep learning models,
and efficient modeling of long time series data.

Previously, I have interned at [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s group where I worked on developing inference algorithms
(based on Bayesian filtering and smoothing) for a nonstationary Gaussian Process.
I did my [master's thesis](https://erepo.uef.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/26001/urn_nbn_fi_uef-20211253.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) on Botnet Command &amp; Control detection for IoT networks at [Ericsson - Finland](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/finland).

I have earned my master's degree in information technology with a minor in statistics from the [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en),
and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration from [Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane](http://www.aui.ma/en/).
