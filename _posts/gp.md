# Gaussian Processes?! But why?

This is a little rambling about what are Gaussian Processes (with a focus on intuition) and why you should care about them. 

- Regression task: considers all points in the line to be samples from a Gaussian distribution, can evaluate the function on new points given the evaluation at old points
  - function view
- Linear regression = GP
- But GPs can also do more!
- connection to filtering/smoothing
- weighted basis view
