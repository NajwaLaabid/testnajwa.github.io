# DYNAMICAL DIFFUSION: LEARNING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS WITH DIFFUSION MODELS
- predictive learning as conditional generation
- integrating temporal dynamics into diffusion processes
- diffusion models and elbo (and other losses)
- conditional model: add condition to reverse process during training
- forward process: introduce a link between current noised state and previous latent state
