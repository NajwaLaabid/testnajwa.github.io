# ML and Algorithmic Problems Specific to Retrosynthesis:
Key challenges you should be prepared to discuss:
## Graph representation of molecules (how to encode molecular structure)
## Handling variable-sized inputs (molecules can have different numbers of atoms)
## Dealing with chemical symmetry and equivalent representations
## Forward vs reverse prediction challenges in retrosynthesis
## Multi-step pathway planning
## Validity checking of predicted molecules
## Handling sparse reaction data
## Incorporating chemical rules and constraints

# General ML Problems:
## Different types of neural networks (especially graph neural networks)
## Loss functions and their trade-offs
## Overfitting and regularization
## Gradient descent optimization
## Model evaluation metrics
## Handling imbalanced datasets
## Cross-validation strategies
## Attention mechanisms
## Transfer learning

# Technologies
## Python's Pandas
- pros and cons
- underlying data structure: time/space complexity
- basic manoeuvres: stats, aggregation, apply functions, plots, save/export data

## Data structures & Algorithms to know
